Title: SynKD: A GAN-Driven Knowledge Distillation Framework for Anchor-Free Real-Time Detection on Edge Devices

Abstract:
Real-time object detection on resource-constrained edge devices demands models that balance accuracy, speed, and efficiency. While single-stage detectors like SSD excel in speed, they struggle with small objects and computational overhead. This paper proposes SynKD, a novel framework that synergizes knowledge distillation (KD), synthetic data augmentation, and anchor-free detection to address these limitations. Our key innovation lies in jointly training a two-stage teacher (Faster R-CNN) and a lightweight anchor-free student using GAN-augmented data, enabling the student to mimic the teacherâ€™s localization precision and semantic richness while eliminating region proposal overhead. To bridge the sim2real gap, we introduce a GAN-based domain adaptor that generates small-object-enriched synthetic data, directly used for distillation. Further, we propose a gradient-sensitive pruning technique that preserves small-object detection capability post-quantization. The end-goal of this framework is to outperform state-of-the-art efficient detectors (YOLO-NAS, NanoDet) in accuracy-speed trade-offs, making it ideal for robots and autonomous systems.
