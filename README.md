## Single Shot Multibox Detector

Potential ideas step-by-step:
1. Choose a Lightweight Baseline: e.g., SSD-lite or YOLO-lite with a small backbone.
2. Add Targeted Improvements:
  - Introduce anchor-free heads if you want to simplify anchor engineering.
  - Incorporate attention or minimal Transformer blocks for better long-range context.
  - Use strong data augmentation (Mosaic, MixUp) for better small-object coverage.
3. Distill from a Powerful Teacher: Train a bigger model on the same dataset and distill the knowledge into your chosen architecture.
4. Optimize Speed & Size: Apply pruning and quantization to get real-time FPS on your hardware.
5. Ablate and Validate: Thoroughly test each componentâ€™s contribution using standard benchmarks (COCO, VOC) and real-world scenarios if possible.
